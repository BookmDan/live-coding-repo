#How to Use
Upon starting the application, you can navigate to either your own recipe box or a page to scroll and search through new recipes. Should you find a new recipe that you like, click the "Add to My Recipe Box" button to auto-populate the form to add a new recipe. Double-check to make sure the input info is correct and then hit submit. The same process above works for any recipe you may come across and want to store.

Search recipes by name by simply typing and seeing the results narrow accordingly. If you search in your own recipe box, you also have the option to filter through recipes specific to meal; Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, etc.
