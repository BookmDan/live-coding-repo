# Recipe Box
## A Better Way to Store your Online Recipes

### Description:

### Project Details
This project is styled with vanilla CSS and was built by Andrew Smit. He gave permission to Ben Aschenbrenner to clone and use it for educational purposes for Flatiron School. 

### Installation
Fork and clone the repo and then change into the directory you created.
When you are in the newly created directory run ``` json-server --watch db.json ```

Then run ```npm install && npm start ``` to download all dependencies and run the project on your local server. Since the back-end was deployed first, it will connect to localhost:3000 and your front end will ask to run on a different network. Click "Y" for "yes" and the page should deploy accordingly.

**In order for the project to run properly, the back-end repo needs to be run on localhost:3000 while the front end runs on 3001.**
